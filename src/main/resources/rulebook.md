## $dark_green Gameplay$

The world border for all worlds is 8,000 blocks from the center. Because of how
$dark_red Nether Portal$ travel works, you will not be able to light them past 1,000 blocks
from the center. You may build wherever you like! Try /rtp to help find a spot!

This server uses a $red Death Chest$ system. Upon death, a campfire with your items
will spawn at your death location. It will last for 10 minutes before your items
drop on the ground! You can have up to 3 $red Death Chests$ at a time.

## $dark_aqua Trading$

We use chest chops for player to trade good for $gold Coins$. Coins may be
earned through selling goods to other players, paying/receiving money for a
service, or by selling goods to the server itself.

Chest shops can buy or sell items! To make a shop, place a chest and shift-click
with the item you want to sell or buy. Regular users may have up to 6 shops at a
time.
